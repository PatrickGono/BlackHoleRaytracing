# BlackHoleRaytracing

This is a simple OpenGL project (written in C++ and GLSL) to render the light bending in the vicinity of a black hole in real time. The rendering is achieved using a path tracing algorithm, simulating the curved path of each ray as it passes through a Schwarzschild metric. The accretion disc is represented by a flat, textured disc.
